# Design-and-Analysis-of-a-DC-Nano-Grid-System
In this report, renewable energy types and adoption rates over time were introduced. Then a DC Nano-Grid System fed by PV Array of cells was designed and simulated using MATLAB, PID controllers were used to get the desired behavior of the system. In addition to applying MPPT algorithm to increase the efficiency of the system.
